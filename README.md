## Lessons Learned

While making this project it is obvious that I faced a series of problems, each one made me a better developer and that's what's amazing about self-learning. depending on myself is necessary during the process. I also learned how to search and try to fix any issue, and not just that, but writing better & maintainable code is included in the things I learned in this project ðŸ˜‡
